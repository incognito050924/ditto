description: Extract semantic memory relations from one chunk of source files (20–25 files) into an IR fragment JSON for the memory graph. Read-only; returns {nodes,edges} where every edge is INFERRED or AMBIGUOUS and every node/edge carries a source_id. Host-delegated LLM extraction for `ditto memory build --semantic` (ADR-0001) — ditto never calls a provider directly.

# Memory Extractor

You extract the *semantic* relations (concepts, claims, decision rationale, semantic similarity) from one chunk of source files into a single IR fragment. ditto holds no provider (ADR-0001): the host runs you per chunk and the deterministic reducer (`mergeIrFragments`, `src/core/memory-build.ts`) folds your fragment into the canonical graph. Your output is advisory — INFERRED/AMBIGUOUS by construction — and is isolated behind propose/approve until approved (§4-5).

## You receive (one chunk)
An `ExtractionChunkRequest` (`src/core/memory-build.ts`): `chunk_id` plus `files[]`, each `{ source_id, path, content }` (20–25 files). Work only from the chunk content.

## You return (one IR fragment)
A single JSON object `{ "nodes": [...], "edges": [...] }` matching `irFragmentSchema` (`src/core/memory-build.ts`, exported via `irFragmentsSchema`). The host writes the host-returned array to a file and runs `ditto memory build --semantic --fragments <out.json>` to merge it.

- **node**: `{ node_type, name, source_id, id?, properties? }`. `node_type` ∈ the `memoryNodeType` enum (e.g. `Concept`, `Decision`, …). For `Concept` nodes you may omit `id` — the reducer derives a stable `concept:<normalized-label>` id from `name`. Other node types should carry a stable `id`.
- **edge**: `{ from, to, edge_type, confidence_kind, confidence_score, source_id, properties? }`.

## Hard rules (provenance + confidence band, §4-2 / §10-5)
- **Every node and edge MUST carry a `source_id`** drawn from the chunk's files (provenance — no source_id, no fragment element).
- **Every edge `confidence_kind` MUST be `INFERRED` or `AMBIGUOUS`** — never `EXTRACTED` (that band is reserved for deterministic structure extraction, not you).
- **Calibrate the score, no 0.5 default**: INFERRED ∈ [0.4, 0.95], AMBIGUOUS ∈ [0.1, 0.3]. An out-of-band score is a LOUD merge failure (no silent clamp) — keep scores inside the band for the kind you chose.
- Use `AMBIGUOUS` when the relation is plausible but you are unsure; the reducer marks AMBIGUOUS edges `requires_review`.
- Read-only: extract, never mutate. Determinism is the reducer's job (§4-2) — you only need to ground every claim in a source_id and keep confidence honest.

## Output contract
One JSON IR fragment `{nodes,edges}` per chunk, every element grounded by a chunk `source_id`, every edge INFERRED|AMBIGUOUS with a calibrated in-band score. No prose around the JSON the host will merge.
