 * Forward re-expansion planner (autopilot §2.4 · §4.3).
 *
 * The node-*between* convergence loop ("수정+재리뷰까지 issues 0"). It is NOT a
 * back-edge to the review node — that would break the DAG/cycle-free invariant
 * (§2.1). Instead a `review`/`verify`/`security` node that still has findings
 * spawns a *new* `fix` node + *new* `review` node whose edges always point at an
 * already-existing node, so the merged graph stays acyclic and `addNodes`
 * (`validateNodeAddition`) accepts the splice.
 *
 * This is a pure planner — it owns no I/O and mutates nothing. The driver decides
 * to call it, splices the returned nodes through `AutopilotStore.addNodes`, and
 * tracks `round`. It is kept separate from `recordResult` on purpose: that path
 * owns the node-*internal* retry layer (`attempts`), and §2.4 forbids mixing the
 * two convergence layers.
